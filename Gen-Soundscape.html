            <b>Process & Intentions:</b>
            Another work made in MaxMSP 8, I made a generative soundscape system. I did this to experiment rather than doing the traditional way of music/sound making. 
            The reference page was useful when learning each block. I experimented by testing the connected blocks and got many different generative sounds while adding some interactive functions. 
            I wanted to give people a whole new experience with a generative sound based on different parameters they could play with. I learned a lot from MaxMSP 8 and there is still quite a bit I donâ€™t fully know or understand about this software.
             Playing around with sound is one of my interests and I see myself doing it as part of game design.
