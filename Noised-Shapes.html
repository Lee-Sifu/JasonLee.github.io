            <b>Process & Intentions:</b>
            I created this noised-based shapes work in P5. I experimented by adding some shapes and gave them random noise parameters. The colours were very fun to play around with, especially when added the ambience material/light. 
            The background and shapes colour changes if your in light or dark mode inside the editor.
            However, one of the challenges was trying to make it less chaotic so that it was still visually appealing to users.  
            I don't think I see myself doing something related to this as a career choice, but I did enjoy the experience of experimenting with creative code. 
            There are endless possibilities to explore and I would like to share my works for people to see and enjoy.
