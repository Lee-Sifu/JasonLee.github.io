            <b>Process & Intentions:</b>
            My portfolio website was made from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. GitHub was also used to get my website up and running. 
            Although it lacked some functionality like the contact page and download buttons, the other thing is I tried putting it as a Github page but there were some issues I could't get it working. 
            I thought about doing this to demonstrate my skills and knowledge of how to make a website without the use of web templates from sources like Wix or WordPress. 
            This would allow me to build anything if I wanted to present something to people. 
            I did have to learn from a tutorial since I lacked some HTML and CSS knowledge. 
            Additionally, I had some JavaScript knowledge from P5, but am still currently learning. 
            While I enjoyed learning about creating a website from scratch, it also helped me understand from both the designer's and the developer's point of view.
