            <b>Process & Intentions:</b>
            I created this sound visualizer because I wanted to merge two mediums: music and interactive feedback with the help of P5.js.
            I looked through the library of p5 that offered anything related to music and looked for mathematical concepts on YouTube. 
            I wanted to give users an immersive experience with audio-reactive systems. As a test I uploaded a recorded file song from YouTube in the sketch files. Later I used my own made in Logic Pro using the sound library.  
            Based on this experience, I find it very helpful in creative coding because it improves my coding and critical thinking skills. 
            At the same time, I do not think it will ever become a career journey, but it will take me to great lengths in my other specialties when it comes to thinking creatively and critically.
