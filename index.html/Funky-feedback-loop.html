            <b>Process & Intentions</b>
            This was made in MaxMSP 8, I wanted to play around with making an interactive feedback loop. 
            I learned a lot about Maxâ€™s jitter system through the reference page and Vizzie tools. The jitter functionality of Max helped me think of what I could do and improve to make immersive and interesting content. 
            It was very enjoyable to test out jitter despite there being some bugs and I may see myself doing something similar within game design that can further explore different ways of giving people a whole new experience.
