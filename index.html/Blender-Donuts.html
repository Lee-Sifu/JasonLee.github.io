            <b>Process & Intentions:</b>
            This was my first time using a 3d modeling software and in my opinion, Blender 4.3 was a good beginner choice.
            There was so much within 3d modeling that I had zero experience with, so I went with something simple, but tried to make it unique. 
            Despite the learning curve, I was able to learn Blenderâ€™s UI and tools to get a better understanding and build a solid foundation overtime within 3d modeling. 
            The final version was a turntable using UE5 to render the scene and colour grading in Davinci. I did this instead of making multiple images because I felt it would look better that way in addition to looking more cinematic. 
            This also helped me explore a side of Unreal that I have yet to experience, despite multiple issues I came across.
