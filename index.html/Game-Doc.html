            <b>Process & Intentions:</b>
            I made a game document for my passion project. I am still in the early stages but the concept is finished.
             I did it to demonstrate my knowledge and deep enthusiasm in game design. 
             I took  inspiration from other indie titles like Dead Cells, Katana Zero, etc and references of real life. 
             I hope to give people a good idea of what my documentation showcases. 
             I also hope to improve my skills in game design while exploring more than just design itself and to collaborate with other enthusiasts in the future.
