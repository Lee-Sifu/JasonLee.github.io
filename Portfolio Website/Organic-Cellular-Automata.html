            <b>Process & Intentions:</b>
            I was greatly inspired by the concept of cellular automata, a system that over time evolves based on simple rules and results in complex patterns. 
            Using TouchDesigner was helpful in creating an organic-looking cellular automata as well as in trying to see if I could make complex patterns through experimenting with TouchDesigner's Operators. 
            There was so much to learn from TouchDesigner's UI and tools. The overall goal was to see how immersive and organic I could try to make it using TouchDesigner. 
            Using TouchDesigner as a way to create visually appealing and unique works is another great tool besides P5.js and I really see myself exploring so much with Touchdesigner.
