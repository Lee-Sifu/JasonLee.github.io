            <b>Process & Intentions:</b>
            In Unreal Engine 5.3 I created this architecture visualization using Chinatown as a subject. This was part of my Programs final project at Dawson College.
            I used the third-person template and got premade assets from the Unreal Engine marketplace (now Fab). 
            I didn’t make any models from any 3d tools at the time so the premade assets that resemble Asian architecture helped me. 
            Instead of making a realistic copy of Chinatown, Montréal, I chose to do my own version of what Chinatown would look like without all these modern changes. 
            I tried adding some kind of reminiscence of Chinese culture, such as fireworks during Chinese New Year as well as some royalty, copyrighted free music in certain locations. At some point, I thought of adding some game elements which could turn this into some kind of gamified architectural simulation. 
            People would be able to explore and interact with certain areas and learn more about it.
