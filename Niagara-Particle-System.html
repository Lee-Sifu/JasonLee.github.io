            <b>Process & Intentions:</b>
            In Unreal Engine 5.4, I utilized Unreal’s Niagara system to make an immersive particle system. 
            I was inspired by another artist who used Niagara to make an immersive particle and I added my own changes to it by adding some interactive functions such as immersive generated soundscape from MaxMSP and edited in Fl. 
            I thought of using photos as textures instead of creating a custom material for a more dynamic look. 
            I hoped to provide people with a good experience by playing around with the simulated effects while feeling immersed. 
            Experimenting with Unreal’s powerful Niagara system helped me think of how I can use it in other ways besides in games. 
            I hope to further explore it and come up with new ways to create in Unreal and maybe merge with other mediums.
